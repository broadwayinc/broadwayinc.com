<h1>Complexity of Modern Web Development</h1>

<p>
  Web development was once straightforward: code a server, deploy it, and let it interact directly with users.
  Everything, including code, data, and files, was centralized.

  <br>
  <br>

  However, the landscape has drastically changed. The advent of cloud computing, no-code/low-code solutions, and a
  variety of frameworks was meant to streamline development. Ironically, this evolution introduced more complexity.
  Developers are now faced with navigating through multiple frameworks, dealing with complex server configurations, and
  often requiring expert intervention during deployment.

  <br>
  <br>

  At Broadway Inc., we've envisioned a different approach – one that simplifies solutions in modern web development
  without compromising capabilities.
</p>
<br>
<h2>
  Back to Basics with HTML
</h2>
<p>
  Websites work best when they're built with static HTML. Nowadays, lots of cloud services let you host your HTML, and
  modern browsers are great at running complex JavaScript code.
  <br>
  <br>
  Hence, it seems we don't really need servers to render HTML anymore.
  We are living in an age where we have tons of SPA frameworks to do that, yet we still see a lot flocking back to SSR
  using SPA frameworks, making it no different than PHP.
  This trend persists mainly because, despite significant advancements on the frontend, the approach to structuring
  backend servers hasn't changed much.
  <br>
  <br>
  We want to change that.
  <br>
  <br>
  By reimagining how backend servers are constructed, we seek to simplify the process of web development,
  even for those based on static HTML.
</p>

<h4>
  Embracing Serverless Technologies
</h4>

<p>
  We distilled backend servers only to their essence: serving user requests securely and efficiently.
  By harnessing serverless technologies, we can do this while eliminating the need for conventional server management.
</p>

<h4>
  Leveraging Existing Cloud Services
</h4>

<p>
  Many cloud services have already solved numerous problems in modern web development.
  The real challenge was integrating these services into a usable server.
  <br>
  <br>
  We've streamlined this process by interconnecting these services using serverless lambda functions,
  freeing developers from the complexities of cloud service configurations.
</p>

<h4>
  Redefining the Database
</h4>

<p>
  Traditional databases often come with complex designs, strict security measures, and detailed indexing strategies.
  <br>
  <br>
  We're changing this paradigm by introducing a user-centric database model.
  <br>
  <br>
  Based on key-value stores and advanced techniques using lexicographical sorting, we've made it possible for users to
  determine their data structures, security levels, and indexing of their data.
  <br>
  <br>
  We believe the user is the owner of their data, and should be the
  one to decide how their data should be stored and accessed. This shift removes the prerequisite of designing database
  schemas from the backend, also assuring security and flexibility with high performance.
</p>

<h2>Introducing Skapi: Backend API Library for Frontend HTML</h2>

<p>
  In alignment with our vision, we have developed Skapi, a frontend JavaScript library that connects you to our robust
  serverless API solutions. Skapi empowers you to create full-stack web applications directly within your HTML
  environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  Say goodbye to the complexities of configuration, database design, and server deployment.
  Skapi streamlines your development, letting you focus solely on building.
  <br>
  <br>
  Skapi comes packed with a comprehensive array of features, including user security, CDN, databases, email servers,
  file storage, real-time data, and much more – all integrated seamlessly and accessible directly from your frontend.
  <br>
  <br>
  Compatible with vanilla HTML and various frontend frameworks, Skapi guarantees that your HTML and JavaScript are the
  only tools required to develop a sophisticated and robust web service.
