<h1>Complexity of Modern Web Development</h1>

<p>
  Web development was once straightforward: code a server, deploy it, and let it interact directly with users.
  Everything, including code, data, and files, was centralized.

  <br>
  <br>

  However, the landscape has drastically changed. The advent of cloud computing, no-code/low-code solutions, and a
  variety of frameworks was meant to streamline development. Ironically, this evolution introduced more complexity.
  Developers are now faced with navigating through multiple frameworks, dealing with complex server configurations, and
  often requiring expert intervention during deployment.

  <br>
  <br>

  At Broadway Inc., we've envisioned a different approach – one that simplifies solutions in modern web development
  without compromising capabilities.
</p>
<br>
<h2>
  Back to Basics with HTML
</h2>
<p>
  A website works best when it's built with static HTML. These days, there are many cloud services available to host your
  HTML, and modern browsers can easily handle complex JavaScript code.
  <br>
  <br>
  So, we don't really need servers to render HTML anymore. 
  We are living in an age where we have tons of SPA frameworks to do that, yet we still see a lot flocking back to SSR
  using SPA frameworks, making it no different than PHP.
  This is mainly because, even though we've made a lot of improvements on the frontend, the backend hasn't changed much.
  <br>
  <br>
  We want to change that.
  <br>
  <br>
  We plan to use the power of modern browsers and new backend technologies to make dynamic web applications work well,
  even when they are hosted on simple, static HTML.
</p>

<h4>
  Embracing Serverless Technologies
</h4>

<p>
  We distilled backend servers only to their essence: serving user requests securely and efficiently.
  By harnessing serverless technologies, we can do this while eliminating the need for conventional server management.
</p>

<h4>
  Leveraging Existing Cloud Services
</h4>

<p>
  Many cloud services have already solved numerous problems in modern web development.
  The real challenge was integrating these services into a usable server.
  We've simplified this by connecting these services with serverless lambda functions, thus freeing
  developers from the complexities of cloud service configurations.
</p>

<h4>
  Redefining the Database
</h4>

<p>
  Traditional databases often come with complex designs, strict security measures, and detailed indexing strategies.
  <br>
  <br>
  We're changing this paradigm by introducing a user-centric database model.
  <br>
  <br>
  Based on key-value stores and advanced techniques using lexicographical sorting, we've made it possible for users to
  determine their data structures, security levels, and indexing of their data.
  <br>
  <br>
  We believe the user is the owner of their data, and should be the
  one to decide how their data should be stored and accessed. This shift removes the prerequisite of designing database
  schemas from the backend, also assuring security and flexibility with high performance.
</p>
